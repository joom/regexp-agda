> I was intrigued about what it would be like, and found it to contain a useful development of an algorithm within a dependently-typed setting. What was less clear was the intended readership for the paper. While it could be used as a - relatively advanced - illustration of dependently-typed programming (in Agda), it is certainly not written to be such an introduction. Instead, it depends on

> These latter two areas would not be obvious to a learner, but it is difficult to read the paper without knowing at least something about them. While making these comparisons is useful, they are more in the form of a commentary, which would stand alongside a separate pedagogical development of the algorithms. In particular, it would have been interesting to see how the higher-order version, that requires an explicit termination counter, could be seen to come from a transformation of the defunctionalised, first-order version. (What is surprising about the transformation being this way around is that in the original work of Reynolds, it is of course in the other direction: the higher-order version is more intuitive, and the defunctionalised an optimisation of this).
